# Digital Watermarking 
## BestGroupEver - Midterm Project | Financial Technology (FE595)

### Overview
This is the code for digital watermarking of images. We have built a model which embeds watermark to images and decodes it, that can be used to trace the original user with whom it was shared. This technology helps in protecting the author's work and rights, ultimately preventing piracy.
